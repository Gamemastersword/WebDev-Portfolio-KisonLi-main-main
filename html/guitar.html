    <h3>My Experience</h3>
    <p>I started learning guitar during middle school. At first, it was difficult to manage the chords and strumming rhythm. But as time went on, I began to enjoy playing and found it a great way to express emotion and creativity. Now, playing guitar is one of my favorite ways to relax and recharge.</p>

    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Basic finger placement</li>
      <li>Popular songs and fingerstyle techniques</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
    <p>Learning guitar improves finger skills and will always enrich your life.</p>
